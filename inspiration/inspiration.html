<div><h2>Joan Egerkens</h2>
<h3>Egerkrans is a Swedish artist who inspires me because of his work on the Star Academy comics and video games in the early 00s. He created most of the 2d art for the game, and illustrated the entirety of the comics. He also worked on a separate comic series called Star Shine Legacy as well. I love his style, it is so unique and oftentimes whimsical. I also love his use of color, and how he doesn't stray away from more vibrant palettes. I think it really impacts and influences a lot of my personal work and style.</h2>

<div><h2><strong>A Lot like Birds</h2>
<h3>A lot like birds is a post hardcore band formed in Sacramento in 09. These guys inspire me for so many reasons. I think their music is so unique and tonally interesting for the ears. I also really appreciate their lyricism, one of their vocalists (Cory Lockwood) was an English major in school and I think that shines through in a lot of the writing. Not only do I appreciate the tracks themselves, but their live performances are what inspire me the most on a creative level. Their ability to pull together such a solid and entertaining show really gets my brain gears going; I always end up feeling so inspired to create after I see them live or listen to their music, it's like a motivation switch (also the album covers are sick, honorable mention Bradley Edwards for those!)

<h2><strong>Venior</h2>
<h3>Venior is an artist from Finland with a very unique style. She focuses on music, but I am more interested and attached to her physical artworks. Everything she does is so weird and bright. It can definitely be an eye strain, but there's just so much to see! I think its abstract-ness and strange energy is a really big inspiration for me. I always find motivation in seeing people create crazy stuff because I love crazy stuff too, and I think the best way I can express myself through my art is through color, patterns, and texture.
